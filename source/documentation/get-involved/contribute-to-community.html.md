#### Become a Jellyfish
We love to see contributors showing the commitment that means we can make you a committer and invite you join in to shape the future of a project.
Project Jellyfish is a meritocracy. That is, once a contributor has shown sufficient sustained commitment by helping out and contributing work to the project, that contributor may be voted in by the project as a committer.

#### How does one show commitment?
Get involved and contribute issues, documentation, provide patches for documentation, work on the issue tracker or submit code patches. Answering other users' questions is a great way to get started, or suggesting patches or improvements.  If your work shows merit, the Jellyfish Team may hold a vote to invite you to become a committer.  Note that becoming a committer is not just about submitting some patches; it's also about helping out on the development and user discussion lists, helping with documentation and the issue tracker, and showing long-term interest.
