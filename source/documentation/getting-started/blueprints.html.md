#### Basic Cloud Broker

Project Jellyfish is utilizing the Service Catalog capabilities provided by ManageIQ to automate the provisioning of additional cloud services such as storage, virtual machines, and relational databases by different providers. Through the use of the ManageIQ REST API, jellyfish-core is able to send provision request to any created Service Catalog Item, which will fire off the service provisioning. At the end of service provisioning, ManageIQ will send the status of the provisioning with any needed information.
