#### Chef

Project Jellyfish is using the Chef configuration management tool to install, configure, and manage the various software components of the cloud environment, operating system, and project itself.  Using Chef allows Project Jellyfish to move beyond just the abiity of IaaS, and allows us pre-configure systems for specific roles, or to apply base settings to servers (such as security policies or IAM connections), and it allows for rapid patch management (updating 10,000+ servers in a matter of minutes).
